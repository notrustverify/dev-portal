# Integration Options

If you've already gone through the different [Quick Start](/quickstart/overview.md) options, you have seen the possibilities avaliable to you for quickly connecting existing application code to another Nym process. 

This section assumes you wish to integrate with Nym into your application code. 

The [integrations FAQ] has a list of common questions regarding integrating with Nym and Nyx, as well as commonly required links. This is a good place to start. 

If you wish to integrate with Nym to use the mixnet for application traffic, start with the [mixnet integration](/integrations/mixnet-integration.md) page. 

If you wish to integrate with the Nyx blockchain to use `NYM` for payments, start with the [payment ntegration](/integrations/payment-integration.md) page.

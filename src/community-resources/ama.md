# DevRel AMAs

The Nym Technology Developer Relations AMA (Ask Me Anything) is an event organised by the Nym team to engage and connect with the developer community. The AMA provides an opportunity for developers to ask questions and receive answers directly from the Nym team, as well as other members of the community. The event is focused on the Nym technology, which is a privacy-enhancing layer for the internet, but also a great opportunity for developers to learn more about the Nym technology and its potential use cases, as well as to share their own ideas and insights.

> ⚠️ Hosted every fortnight on Wednesday @ 4pm UTC
